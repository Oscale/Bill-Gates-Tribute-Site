    When Microsoft started in 1975, it was just an idea of a company that was seen by Bill Gates and Paul Allen. They were very
    young at the time that they started the company but where very passionate and determined to make software for home computers more
    accessible. It was through them and their overnight and day-to-day dedication which allowed them to start a successful company such
    as Microsoft. Through Bill Gates, he was able to produce the popular operating system known as Windows that is commonly used
    in many computers today. Then as more powerful home computers became more common, Microsoft was able to develop modern versions
    of Windows. Notably, the Windows XP OS was ahead of its time as the utility that it was able to bring to the user was
    exponentially better than any other OS was able to bring at the time. From then on, Microsoft had a major monopoly on operating softwares, which then had put Microsoft on trial, especially since Microsoft had a business strategy which was designed to undercut other software businesses. After this trial, Bill Gates was becoming older and had stepped down from being Ceo and decided to move down to chief software architect. After this in 2016 Bill Gates retired from Microsoft leaving it to stand on its own feet, without the founder as Bill Gates has become really old.
