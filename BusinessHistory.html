    When Microsoft started in 1975, it was just an idea of a company that was for seen, by Bill Gates and Paul Allen. They where very 
    young at the time that they started the company but where very passionate and determined to make software for homecomputers more 
    accesable. It was through them and their overnight and day-to-day dedication which allowed them to start a succesful company such 
    as Mircosoft. Through Bil Gates, he was able to produce the popular operating system known as Windows that is commonly used 
    in many computers today. Then as more powerful home computers became more common, Microsoft was able to develop modern verisons 
    of Windows. Noteablely, the Windows XP OS was ahead of its time as the utiliy that it was able to bring to the user was 
    expoentially better than any other OS was able to bring at the time. From then on, Microsoft had a major monoploy on operating softwares, which then had put Microsoft on trial, esspesically since Mircosoft had a business strategy which was designed to undercut other software business. After this trial, Bill Gates was becoming older and had steped down from being Ceo and decided to move down to chief software archetect. After this in 2016 Bill Gates retired from Mircosoft leaving it to stand on its own feet, without the founder as Bill Gates has became really old.
