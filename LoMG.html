    Bill Gates is a very interesting person, as he took high amounts of interest into computer technology at an early age. His parents say that when his elementary school had obtained a teletype link to a power computer at the time, Bill was tied to the machine so much that he would sneak out out of his house just to go back to the schools compute lab and work with the computer late into the night. From here, he would start his own business with a group of others who also were hooked on computers, developing their own software for computers. 
    <br> <br>
    When a the first commerical home mini-computer was relased Bill Gates offered the owner to produce software for his computers and created MS-DOS. MS-DOS would be the catalyst to Microsoft and many more popular softwares and operating systems later on, including Windows, MacOS, etc. From then on, Bill Gates had to be competeive and ruthless with other compaines who were trying to take down his company Mircosoft.
    <br><br>
    As Microsoft grew Bill Gates found love with Melinda Gates, and also had 3 children. He used a portion of his wealth to provide thousands of libaries with computers so that those who do not have the money to purchase their own computer are able to experience the joy Bill Gates did when he was able to jump onto the wonders of computer technology.
    <br><br>
    Finally, many allegations held towards Bill Gates' company had brought great trouble to Bill later on in his life, since supposed acts for accessablity to his software where though of as hidden means towards monopolization over the software business. As whenever someone else is beging to become succesful in the software business, Microsoft would then do something that would bring the market towards them. 
    <br><br> 
    Still, determined as ever, just like when he was younger he continues on to bulid his company until he decides to retire.

    <b>"We need innovation that gives us energy that’s cheaper than today’s hydrocarbon energy, that has zero CO2 emissions, and that’s as reliable as today’s overall energy system. And when you put all those requirements together, we need an energy miracle. That may make it seem too daunting to people, but in science, miracles are happening all the time." -Bill Gates, <i>The Atlantic 2015</i></b>
